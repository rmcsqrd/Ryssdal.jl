## big picture programmy stuf
- add in functionality for date ranges. currently it just looks at longest data set
- probably refactor everything so each function is its own file
- fix absolute positioning for dataDir variable in AlphaVantage_API_Call
- when it reads if the file or not compare the time stamp of the most recent data vs current state

## actual math stuff
- look at stats for different stocks (mean, covariance, etc) and plot that
- KF?
- pairs trading
- subplots with stationarity, etc (maybe display on main plot as well with shaded areas and stuff)
- some sort of nice looking gui interface with drop downs and such
- how to host? IPYNB? docker image and Genie? find an example
